What's the relation between AgentToken ,AIToken and currencyToken @Cesar Rodriguez @Denett  ?

where i can find the documentation ?


[01/30/2025 12:44] denett
The agent token is an AIToken and that represents the ownership of the Agent. The currency token will be the IQ token and is used to buy/sell the agent token.

Whats the idea behind the `phantomAmount`?


[01/31/2025 08:10] kyosi2963
It acts like a actificial liquidity so the pool does not start with 0 currency tokens, so users don’t get some unreasonable trading rate initially

Hey team, It would be nice of you, if you explain the Intended Flow of the buy() in agentRounter. Thanks


[01/31/2025 09:49] ihtishamsudo
As stated in readme, currency token would be an IERC20 compatible token except (FOT, Rebase) or only IQ Token?


[01/31/2025 09:50] kyosi2963
IQ token is the what we are going to buy using the currency token, currency token could be any standard ERC20 yeah


[01/31/2025 10:06] denett
The currency token is assumed to be a standard ERC20, we will launch using the IQ token. The other side of the pools are the Agent tokens, these are deployed in the factory and as you can see these are also vanilla ERC20 tokens. So we do not have to worry about FOT/rebasing stuff.


[01/31/2025 10:10] denett
It will first find the bootstrap pool for the agent token being traded. If this bootstrap pool has not yet been killed, the swap goes there. If it has been killed, all liquidity has moved over to Fraxswap and the swap is performed there.

votingDelay is the delay between two votes ??


[01/31/2025 13:10] xkeywordx
What `implementation` contracts do you plan on whitelisting for the `Agent`? 

From the contest's page

"Agent Contract which allows for call forwarding to whitelisted implementation contracts."

These implementation contracts, what will they be? I am trying to understand with what type of contracts will the Agent interact with. Are they supposed to be bridges, DEXes, Oracles, or smth else?

{Reactions}
👍 

[01/31/2025 13:42] xkeywordx
Besides this, can you also please provide an example of a `defaultProxyImplementation` that you would add to the `AgentFactory` contract? I'd like to see what functions these implementations will have in order to understand what agents can do.

{Reactions}

[01/31/2025 13:48] blnk_
@xKeywordx from my limited understanding of their website and docs of the overall project I believe that the agents will only be allowed to perform simple tasks such as moving assets, staking etc but dont take my word for it because their docs scarcely ever mention the agents


[01/31/2025 13:52] blnk_
They have some mention of "specialized roles" but idk what that could be

```
**

     * on the clock (see ERC-6372) this contract uses.

     * This can be increased to leave time for users to buy voting power, or delegate it, before the voting of a

[01/31/2025 14:40] denett
The DAO will only whitelist implementations that it deems safe. 
The idea is that the agents will be able to interact with DeFi protocols of their choosing. They start out with a bunch of their own tokens, so they could swap them, or use them as collateral and borrow.


[01/31/2025 14:44] denett
We are still working on them.

Is it possible for the a user to deploy the contracts separately and not follow the AgentFactory flow ?


[01/31/2025 16:40] nour99
how you will make that? you need to call `createAgent()` function to "create Agent" and that will result in deploy all the contracts

[02/04/2025 08:50] kyosi2963
In the contest page it is said tokens with decimals > 18 and < 6 are out-of-scope

{Reactions}
🙏 

[02/04/2025 08:50] kyosi2963
So i guess tokens between 6 and 18 decimals are supported, but do not 100% take my word


[02/04/2025 08:54] davies_0212
I just want to clarify 6~8 decimal currency tokens.


[02/04/2025 09:28] 0xaudron
in fraxtal is there even tokens having  >18, <6 decimals?


[02/04/2025 09:29] 0xaudron
didn’t find much tokens in here tbh, i guess there’s just ~25 tokens deployed on fraxtal chain.

[02/04/2025 09:35] kyosi2963

What are the erc721 tokens in this protocol for?


[02/04/2025 10:15] kyosi2963
Agent contract is an ERC721 , it's only used for a representation of the owner of the agent

{Reactions}
👍 

[02/04/2025 10:38] walodja1987
Why shouldn’t there be tokens with <> 18 decimals on Fraxtal? According to my understanding tokens are not natively part of the Fraxtal chain and are deployed as smart contracts where the dev can set any decimals they want. Correct me if I’m wrong here.


[02/04/2025 10:39] walodja1987
My interpretation is that 6-18 decimals tokens are in scope.


[02/04/2025 10:40] kyosi2963
Same


[02/04/2025 10:47] welith
Well they kinda explicitly say:

> The token will be IQ, so there is no need to review implementations with other tokens.


[02/04/2025 10:49] kyosi2963
How could we know the implementation of the IQ token


[02/04/2025 10:50] kyosi2963

It is used to decide the propsal threshold in governor. If token is in bootstrap phase then basically the proposal threshold is max uin256 meaning the voting is governance is disabled and only after the token is migrated to fraxswap the governance can be functional. As far as i know.

Be aware that's not allowed in C4 to discuss findings in public. This is serious for the both parties sponsors and C4 wardens community. As It would harm the process of both. Thank you -)


[02/08/2025 07:22] zkillua.dev
We cannot discuss findings, but  people with SR role can view submissions. I get it. Nice. Thank you👍


[02/08/2025 07:24] evokid
SR also can't discuss any findings in public as well. But they can view their submissions -)


[02/08/2025 07:25] zkillua.dev
Just their submissions or all submissions?


[02/08/2025 07:27] evokid
You can read about SR features in C4 website. Look at it and see what are the features. Good luck sir.


[02/08/2025 07:29] zkillua.dev

@Jay | C4 After PJQA, nobody can comment?


[02/21/2025 19:06] itsmetechjay
It's possible the judge may re-open comments after the initial post-judging QA period, in which case, we'd adjust the status of the audit back to PJQA.

how will someone know that their submission is valid or invalid after the judging phase ?

You don’t until report is out

Unless you’re SR


[02/22/2025 15:58] pkabhi
so if I have submitted one I need to wait till report is out , that's right ?

Yeah

@Jay | C4 The phase `Reporting` indicates that all matters have been successfully resolved?

Does this mean that no one can discuss any issues with the judges?

I'm confused about this bug. I submitted this one, and it is definitely valid. I wonder if they downgraded into a low. Might be that these days XSS attacks are considered low IDK

[03/01/2025 05:56] willycode20
This was reduced to a low


[03/01/2025 13:13] 0x15_eth
The setInitialPrice function had no validation check on the input supplied by admin…and that parameter determines the price used in liquidity

It could be mistakenly set to 0

Isn’t that a concern ?


[03/01/2025 13:21] alekso1
this sounds quite low even more qa


[03/01/2025 13:21] alekso1
probably caught by bots


[03/01/2025 13:53] 0x15_eth
So are we now judging severity based on how easy it is to find or by the impact on the protocol??

{Reactions}
😅 

[03/01/2025 14:04] alekso1
Oh no i didnt event talk about how easy it is to find, im not even a judge. Just the owner is trusted thus usually its not an issue


[03/01/2025 14:06] 0x15_eth
Yh I get…it’s just that sometimes i wonder why centralization risks in contests are always not considered important….”Admin is always trusted”


[03/01/2025 14:36] undefined_joe
if we want to validate every trusted role (mostly admin and owners) input bug as an issue, then every contest will always end up dishing out cents to auditors.

There are trusted in the sense that, they will always validate the values, before they pass it to a function call.


[03/01/2025 14:37] undefined_joe
so no judge will give a pass mark to an issue that has to do with a trusted role function inputs.

❗ Wardens - please note that the judge has pointed out an error that was made in the awarding of IQ AI. There was a finding group that should have been marked as a valid Medium finding.  We are working to get this adjusted as soon as possible. 

In the meantime, we have deleted the awarding post here and in #c4-updates.  We’ll get a new/updated award announcement posted as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

not sure why it's a low and medium at the same time.


[03/25/2025 15:38] pepobeta
QA report bundles all low-risk finds (can't upgrade later)

If submitted as medium first, it could get awards but risks being downgraded to low (then gets nothing)
So potatoad-sec played it safe by putting in QA report instead of risking a medium submission
