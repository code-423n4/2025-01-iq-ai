**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-01-iq-ai/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

Token will be IQ, so no need to review implementations with other tokens
Whitelisted proxies can be malicious, not need to raise that
Owner will be a multisig
No need gas optimizations since its a cheap L2

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.
